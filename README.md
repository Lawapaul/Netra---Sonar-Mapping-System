# Netra â€“ Real-Time Sonar Mapping System Using Arduino (Group Project)

## Overview
Netra is a group project focused on building a real-time sonar-based obstacle detection and mapping system using Arduino. 
Inspired by sonar and radar systems, this project uses ultrasonic sensors and servo motors to detect the proximity of objects 
and visualize their positions dynamically using Processing 3.

## Features
- Real-time angular scanning using servo motors
- Obstacle detection with ultrasonic sensor
- Visual output on a computer screen via Processing 3
- Adjustable sweep angles and scanning range
- Applications in robotics, surveillance, and underwater navigation

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor (SG90)
- Embedded C
- Processing 3

## How It Works
1. The ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo performs continuous angular sweeps.
2. Distance data is captured at each angle and sent to a computer.
3. Processing 3 software processes and displays the data in a radar-style interface.

## Team Contribution
This project was developed as part of a collaborative team effort. Each member contributed to circuit design, coding,
and visualization integration.

## Future Improvements
- Wireless data transmission
- 3D environment mapping
- Integration with mobile platforms
